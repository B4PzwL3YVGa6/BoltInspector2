		See this information again, or get more
		information about a specific command.

	bucket <path>:
		Create a new bucket at the given path.

	cd <path>:
		Change the current bucket to the
		specified one.

	copy <source path> <destination path>:
		Copy the value from one path to
		another path.

	delete <path>:
		Delete the given key. Works for both
		key/value pairs and for buckets.

	empty [path]:
		Delete all values and buckets stored
		within the given bucket.

	exit:
		Terminate the program.

	list [k|b] [v]:
		List all of the keys in the current
		bucket.

	move <source path> <destination path>:
		Move a value from a given path to
		another location.

	print <path> [s|i|ui|b]:
		Print the value of the specified key.

	rlist [v] [depth=<int>]:
		Recursively list contents of the current
		bucket and all nested buckets.

	write <path> <value> [s|i|ui]:
		Write the value to the specified key.
